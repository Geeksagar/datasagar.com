<p class="mtxtwidget-p">Data visualization describes the presentation of abstract information in graphical form. Data visualization allows us to spot patterns, trends, and correlations that otherwise might go unnoticed in traditional reports, tables, or spreadsheets.</p>
<p class="mtxthidden">Studies show that humans respond to visuals better than any other type of stimuli. The human brain processes visual information 60,000 times faster than text. In fact, visual data accounts for 90 percent of the information transmitted to the brain.</p>

 	<li><strong>Tell a Visual Data Story</strong>
Go beyond simply presenting numbers and facts. Capture insights as visual stories. Build narratives around your data so that its relevance is clearly communicated and easy to understand.</li>
 	<li><strong>Recognize the Signals from the Noise</strong>
A picture really is worth a thousand words. A single graph conveys complex issues far more clearly—and enables users to identify outliers and anomalies much faster.</li>
 	<li><strong>Master a Growing Volume of Data</strong>
The digital universe is expected to double in size every two years. But you don’t have to be overwhelmed. By transforming data into simple visuals, it becomes more meaningful to decision-makers. Visual interaction with large datasets simplifies the analytic process, revealing new business insights that can be turned into a competitive advantage.</li>

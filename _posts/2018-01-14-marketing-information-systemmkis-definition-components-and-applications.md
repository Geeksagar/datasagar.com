<img class="size-medium wp-image-482 alignright" src="https://datasagar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Picture3-300x249.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="249" />
<ul>
 	<li>MkIS collects the information through its subsystems. These subsystems are called components.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>The four main components of Marketing Information System (MIS) are:
<ol>
 	<li>Internal Database</li>
 	<li>Marketing Intelligence System</li>
 	<li>Marketing Research System, and</li>
 	<li>Marketing Decision Support System.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>(a) Internal Record: </strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The first component of MIS is ‘Internal Record’.</li>
 	<li>Marketing managers get lots of information from the internal-records of the company.</li>
 	<li>These records provide current information about sales, costs, inventories, cash flows and account receivable and payable.</li>
 	<li>Many companies maintain their computerized internal records.</li>
 	<li>Inside records help marketing managers to gain faster access to reliable information.<img class="wp-image-481" src="https://datasagar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Picture2-300x155.jpg" alt="Marketing Information System, Components of Marketing Information System" width="478" height="264" /></li>
</ul>
<strong>(b) Marketing Intelligence</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>It collects information from external sources. It provides information about current marketing-environment and changing conditions in the market.</li>
 	<li>This information can be easily gathered from <b>external sources like; magazines, trade journals, commercial press, so on. </b></li>
 	<li>This information <b>cannot be collected from the Annual Reports of the Trade Association and Chambers of Commerce, Annual Report of Companies, etc. </b></li>
 	<li>The salesmen’s report also contains information about market trends.</li>
</ul>
<strong>(c) Marketing Research</strong>

 	<li>It collects data about the problem. This data is tabulated, analyzed and conclusions are drawn.</li>
 	<li>Then the recommendations are given for solving the problem.</li>
 	<li>Marketing research also provides information to the marketing managers.</li>
 	<li>However, this information is specific information. It can be used only for a particular purpose.</li>
 	<li>MkIS and MR are not substitutes of each other. The scope of MkIS is very wide. It includes ‘MR’. However, the scope of MR is very narrow.</li>
</ul>
<strong>(d) Marketing Decision Support System</strong>

 	<li>These are the tools which help the marketing managers to analyze data and to take better marketing decisions.</li>
 	<li>They include hardware, i.e. computer and software programs.</li>

 	<li>Time to Pay back CAC</li>
 	<li>Breakeven Analysis</li>
</ol>
<strong>(1) Evaluating Marketing Plan</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Return on Investment(ROI)</strong> is always a major concern when it comes to marketing or any other business expense.</li>
 	<li>The idea is to check whether the money you put into your marketing plan has resulted in a profit.</li>
 	<li>Must measure the amount spent on each campaign, versus the amount of sales each campaign brought in specifically.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>Another metric to consider is <strong>Marketing Expense To Revenue </strong></li>
</ul>

<strong>(2) Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and (3) Time To Payback CAC</strong>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-489" src="https://datasagar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cacc-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="344" height="243" />

<strong>(4) Breakeven Analysis</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>The purpose of doing a breakeven analysis is to determine exactly when you can expect your business to cover all expenses and start generating a profit—which is a crucial milestone in the early days of any company.</li>
 	<li>A company's breakeven point is the point at which its sales exactly cover its expenses.</li>
 	<li>To compute a company's breakeven point in sales volume, you need to know the values of three variables:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Fixed costs: </b>Costs that are independent of sales volume, such as rent</li>
 	<li><b>Variable costs:</b>Costs that are dependent on sales volume, such as the cost of manufacturing the product</li>
 	<li><b>Selling price</b>of the product</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<b><i>       Breakeven Point in Units = </i></b><b><i>Fixed Costs </i></b><i>÷ </i><b><i>(Price - Variable Costs) </i></b>

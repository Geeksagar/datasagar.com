<strong>Mobile Computing</strong> is a technology that allows transmission of data, voice and video via a computer or any other wireless enabled device without having to be connected to a fixed physical link. The main concept involves
<ul>
 	<li>Mobile communication</li>
 	<li>Mobile hardware</li>
 	<li>Mobile software</li>
</ul>
It is humanâ€“computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video. Mobile computing involves mobile communication, mobile hardware, and mobile software. Communication issues include ad hoc networks and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties, protocols, data formats and concrete technologies. Hardware includes mobile devices or device components. Mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications.

<strong>Principles of Mobile Computing</strong>

<strong>Portability:</strong> Facilitates movement of device(s) within the mobile computing environment.

<strong>Connectivity:</strong> Ability to continuously stay connected with minimal amount of lag/downtime, without being affected by movements of the connected nodes

<strong>Social Interactivity:</strong> Maintaining the connectivity to collaborate with other users, at least within the same environment.

<strong>Individuality:</strong> Adapting the technology to suit individual needs.

<strong>Portability:</strong> Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility.

<strong>Connectivity:</strong> This defines the quality of service (QoS) of the network connectivity. In a mobile computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained at a high level with the minimal amount of lag/downtime without being affected by the mobility of the connected nodes.

<strong>Interactivity:</strong> The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of data.

<strong>Individuality:</strong> A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network often denote an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the technology to cater the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information of each node.

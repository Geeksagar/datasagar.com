Augmented Reality turns the environment around you into a digital interface by placing virtual objects in the real world, in real-time. Augmented Reality can be seen through a wide variety of experiences. We distinguish 3 main categories of Augmented Reality tools.

<strong>Augmented Reality 3D viewers</strong>, like Augment, allow users to place life-size 3D models in your environment with or without the use of trackers. Trackers are simple images that 3D models can be attached to in Augmented Reality.

<strong>Augmented Reality browsers</strong> enrich your camera display with contextual information. For example, you can point your smartphone at a building to display its history or estimated value.

The last way that Augmented Reality is generally experienced is through <strong>gaming</strong>, creating immersive gaming experiences that utilize your actual surroundings. Imagine shooting games with zombies walking in your own bedroom! The biggest use of Augmented Reality gaming to-date is Pokémon Go, allowing users to catch virtual Pokémon who are hidden throughout a map of the real world.

<b>Power BI</b> is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft. It provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, where end users can create reports and dashboards by themselves, without having to depend on information technology staff or database administrators.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup>

Simply, <em>Power BI</em> is Microsoft's cloud-based business intelligence technology that is part of the Office 365 suite, the cloud-based suite of productivity applications.
